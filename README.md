# Xcap : a pipeline for automated structure solution
High-throughput crystallographic approaches require integrated software solutions to minimize the need for manual effort. We are developing a system that allows fully automated crystallographic structure solution by integrating existing crystallographic software into an adaptive and partly autonomous workflow engine. The program should be able to perform homology modeling, molecular-replacement phasing,and refinement without further user intervention. Preset values for each software component allow efficient progress with high-quality data and known parameters. Our solution streamlines commonly used software tools, following well established methodologies, to mimic the process of manual data processing and structure solution to yield high-quality structural models without requiring additional manual manipulation. 
The purpose is to create an automated crystal structure determination platform which executes a number of macro-molecular crystallographic software programs to produce a software pipeline for automated and efficient crystal structure determination to enable making decisions for the scientists.
